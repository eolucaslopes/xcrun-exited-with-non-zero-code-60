# Solution for iOS Simulator Error: xcrun exited with non-zero code: 60

This guide provides a detailed solution to the error encountered when attempting to launch the iOS simulator on macOS. The error prevents the simulator from loading properly due to issues with the Xcode cache.

## Encountered Error

When starting the iOS simulator, the following error may appear in the terminal:

Error: xcrun exited with non-zero code: 60
An error was encountered processing the command (domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain, code=60):
Unable to boot the Simulator.
launchd failed to respond.
Underlying error (domain=com.apple.SimLaunchHostService.RequestError, code=4):
Failed to start launchd_sim: could not bind to session, launchd_sim may have crashed or quit responding


## Cause of the Error

This error is often caused by a corrupted or problematic Xcode cache, which interferes with the simulator's initialization.

## Step-by-Step Solution

To resolve this issue, clear the Xcode cache using the following steps in the system settings:

1. Open **System Settings** on your Mac.
2. Navigate to **General > Storage**.
3. Select the **Developer** option.
4. Find and select the **Xcode cache**.
5. Click **Delete** to clear the cache.

## Verification

After clearing the cache, try to launch the simulator again to check if the problem has been resolved. If the error persists, consider restarting your Mac, which can help resolve any remaining communication issues between Xcode and the iOS simulator services.

## Conclusion

Clearing the Xcode cache is a common measure to address failures in the iOS simulator and other development-related issues with Xcode. If this solution does not resolve the issue, reinstalling Xcode or checking for software updates may be necessary.
